# SuperBase
This is a simple pratice repository I am using for testing Git codes.
I am adding new read me text to this README.md file on SuperBase.
So far I create a repository the discription I gave at this time appeared on an all new text file titled README.md
I read: "# SuperBase
This is a simple pratice repository I am using for testing Git codes."
The readme-edits branch is to edit this actual text.
I'm seeing with branching that different texts are a copy of the first from my master branch.
