# SuperBase
This is a simple practice repository I am using for testing Git codes.
I am adding new read me text to this README.md file on SuperBase.
So far I created a repository the discription I gave at this time appeared on an all new text file titled README.md
It read: "# SuperBase
This is a simple pratice repository I am using for testing Git codes."
The readme-edits branch is to edit this actual text.
I'm seeing with branching that different texts are a copy of the first from my master branch.
Now before creating a pull request I noticed some text to add and some to change.
This pull request is supposed to come with created changes and then merged into the branch for an overall view into the branch it was pulled into. This process also shows the differences of the two files in colors coded in green and red.
I've based the tutorial text here from this site - https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/
The page is about using opening a repository and using processes with branches, commits, and pull request.
